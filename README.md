# Supervised Multiclass Classification Problem

## Lessons:
* Dataset is imbalanced (90% is labeled category 3, 9% category 2 and 1% category 1)
* I learned about the accuracy paradox and using different metrics (f1score,precision,recall) for this label imbalance.
* Preprocessing categorical data into numerical data via one hot encoding
* scaling of numerical data to range [0,1]
* splitting data in train,validation and test set
* using keras to implement a Neural Network as Classifier
* comparing results to baseline RandomForest Classifier 
* tweaking parameters of algorithms and network architecture in search for a better performance
