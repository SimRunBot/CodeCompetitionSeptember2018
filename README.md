# Supervised Multiclass Classification Problem
# The Training set is also imbalanced.

# Lessons:
# Preprocessing categorical data into numerical data via one hot encoding
# scaling of numerical data to range [0,1]
# splitting data in train,validation and test set

# using keras to implement a Neural Network as Classifier
# comparing results to RandomForest Classifier 
# I learned about the accuracy paradox and using different metrics (f1score,precision,recall) for this label imbalance.
# Confusion Matrix,
